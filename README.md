**The more dimensions you add, the lower the quality should be. Setting the quality too high could slow down your computer.**


There are just spheres now, but more objects are coming soon.

Create multi-dimensional shapes (projected onto the plane).  
It uses linear algebra to calculate how to project objects.

To add another dimension, just add another column in the matrix. There should only be two rows.

Requires:  
Numpy  
Python 2  
Tkinter (this should come with Python)  
Gtk

You can install the dependencies using pip:  
```
pip install PyGTK numpy
```
